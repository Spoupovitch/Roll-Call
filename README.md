# Roll-Call
Website for segmenting one roster into multiple, then recombining.

Requires MySQL server for data processing.

<hr>

Have you ever had a long list of names to 'check off?'

So many names that you have a few helpers take sections of the overall list?

Printing out multiple copies and giving a few pages to each helper is inconvenient, precarious and slow.

What if someone gets in the wrong line?

What if you want to search up a name in your section more quickly?

## Instructions

Give Roll-Call a list of names (ordered last, first or first last).

Select what section you will be responsible for.

You will be able to check off names in your section and if someone gets to the front of the wrong line, no problem, you can check them off too!

Once you're done, compile all of the sections and get a new file with the checked and unchecked names.
